## The good
- Testing is important and automated testing is great BUT not a complete drop-in replacement for QA as the writer suggests.
- TDD can be a good way to produce software in many cases, but it is not the silver bullet as no such thing exists.
  - no prod code before a test fails
  - no more test than is needed to fail
  - no more prod than is needed to pass
- Working extra hours doesn't mean extra work being done. (Writer recommends 2 weeks max of overtime).
- False delivery is a real problem, marking something as complete just to call it complete will only cause more harm.
- Pair programming is a very powerful way to produce good programs, but programming alone is not irrelevant because of it, it's still needed
- Music was not marked as an all-encompassing evil as I predicted, it was only side noted, that it doesn't work for the writer but might work for others.
- GOTO is bad...kind of programming basics over here but still true.
- TDD limits defect injection rate
- Document everything
  - unit tests are documentation too
- Specifying GUIs up front is usually a bad idea.
- The GUI should invoke functions through an API rather than fixing them directly to functions. This makes the interface testable (AT/UT).
- Continuous Integration. Basically, run tests and stuff when something changes on the repo's side.
- Meetings are necessary, costly time wasters
  - You can say no to meetings, don't attend everything, especially if you can't afford to
  - Stand-Up meetings in Agile should not take much more than 10 minutes
- Manage your focus levels, don't burn yourself out in 2 hours of starting your shift
  - Writer suggests every 25 minutes, a 5 minute no interruptions full zen break, and every 4th period you take a longer break.
- "Owned code" is a bad thing that happens all the time.
- Git is good
- Issue tracking like Trello is good

## The bad

- It opens with 40 pages of filler. A bad sign to me, signals that this person is more into writing books than programming.
  - By filler I mean personal life, barely relevant stories about the writer's childhood.
- Spending an extra 20 hours per week on work outside of work should not be labeled as "professionalism", it's more "obsession" or "passion", and should not be the baseline expected behavior.
  - I guess that makes me a non-professional in Martin's eyes...
- His "woke observation" of us still using if and while statements is used for a completely wrong conclusion to say that old technologies are still relevant.
- "we should know everything about the legacy, even though we don't use it anymore" is a message I completely disagree with.
- He proceeds to list a good number of methodologies and design principles that he deems a "must" in every "software professional's" life, but again includes lots of outdated, specifically avoided things in modern environments, that have been proven useless or harmful to progress. He calls this list "minimal" by the way...
- The whole book seems to be a power trip aimed at making people think that old technologies are relevant, and the writer urges the readers to learn COBOL and other similarly dated languages to better themselves.
- "The best way to learn is to teach." is the most infuriating line I've read so far.
- "Know your domain" is almost a good thought, but the extent the writer goes to, is absurdly overkill.
- Proceeds to recite the same programming story from the 70s that took up about 10 pages on the opener, and takes another 4 here.
- The entire chapter of "Saying no" is filled with weirdly structured, made-up conversations that seemingly get worse with each example, but the writer praises the amount of extra complication being introduced into the communication.
- This book is pretending to be about communication, but is lowkey a power trip for the writer to tell us all about the good old days.
- Kinda funny how the "Saying yes" chapter is kind of also about saying no lol.
- "Build times should be measured in seconds, not minutes and certainly not hours" is a statement that dates this book extremely. Have you heard of docker, my guy?
- I do not care about you studying JUJITSU my man...
- "Estimates are commitments" is another statement I disagree with, this should be covered by basic communication skills, and the notion that an estimate is never a guarantee.
- "To stay calm under pressure, avoid the cause of pressure" is the dumbest take I've ever heard. Possibly on anything.
- The chapter about mentoring is almost completely taken over by another set of old timey stories...
- Another VI hipster
