- Liskov substitution principle: "Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it."
- Interface segregation principle: "Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."
- Dependency inversion principle: "Depend upon abstractions, not concretions."
